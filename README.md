# React Native Aviator Game ‚Äì A Thrilling Multiplayer Betting Game ‚úàÔ∏èüé∞
A high-intensity, real-time betting game built with React Native, inspired by the popular "Aviator" crash game. Players place bets and watch as the multiplier climbs‚Äîcash out before the plane crashes to win big! This project features smooth animations, multiplayer support, and a dynamic UI for an engaging gaming experience.

Key Features
The game offers real-time multiplayer functionality with a dynamically increasing multiplier system. Players can place bets before each round starts and must strategically decide when to cash out as the multiplier rises. The application includes a live leaderboard to track top performers and an in-game chat system for player interaction.

For user experience, the game features smooth animations of the plane's flight path and crash sequence, with responsive controls optimized for mobile devices. The UI supports both light and dark modes for comfortable gameplay in any lighting condition. Security is implemented through provably fair algorithms to ensure transparent gameplay, with optional Firebase authentication for user accounts.

Technical Implementation
Built using React Native and Expo for cross-platform compatibility, the application utilizes Redux for state management to handle complex game states and user data. Real-time multiplayer functionality is achieved through WebSocket connections via Socket.io or Firebase Realtime Database. Animations are implemented using React Native Reanimated and Lottie for high-performance visual effects.

The backend architecture supports virtual currency transactions, with potential for integration with payment gateways for real-money gameplay. The codebase follows modular component structure for maintainability, with clear separation between game logic, UI components, and networking layers.
